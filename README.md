# Data Science Projects  

I have completed on the two in-depth capstone projects in the Springboard Data Science Career Track.

### **[Capstone Project 1: Prediction of Scores for Public Schools in California](https://github.com/ahrimhan/data-science-project/tree/master/project1)**


### **[Capstone Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/ahrimhan/data-science-project/tree/master/project2)**
